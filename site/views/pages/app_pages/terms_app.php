                                    Liability on the use of a Vendor’s Product Description Section
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    GetValue.co claim of liability on a Vendors Product Description Section is that, GetValue.co only provides 
                                    the <strong>Vendor’s Product Description Section </strong>as a free service to our valued Vendors. The contents 
                                    of all material made available via the <strong>Vendor’s Product Description Section</strong> are provided solely 
                                    by the individual Vendor and not by GetValue.co. Therefore the <strong>Vendor’s Product Description 
                                    Section</strong> is intended to help Vendors provide their product’s descriptions, Affiliates information and 
                                    their promotions about their products. While GetValue.co requires Vendors using their <strong>Vendor’s 
                                    Product Description Section</strong> to present only accurate and reliable information, GetValue.co does 
                                    not independently review or verify information submitted by Vendors for accuracy, completeness, efficacy, or 
                                    timeliness. Therefore GetValue.co does not guarantee, or assume any responsibility or liability for, the 
                                    accuracy, completeness, efficacy, or timeliness of any such information nor is it responsible for any bonuses, 
                                    prizes, or other incentives offered by Vendors. Your use of any information presented by a Vendor is voluntary, 
                                    and your reliance is at your own risk.
                                </p>

                                </p>

While GetValue.co permits its vendors to offer shipped delivery of printed media (books, CD’s, and DVD’s), it doesn’t involve itself in any activities concerning all the shipped delivery of those printed media and the liability concerning all the activities including the products themselves remains to the vendor responsibility.</li>

                                    GetValue.co claim of liability on the <strong>Affiliate Blogging Section</strong> is that, GetValue.co only 
                                    provides the “<strong>Affiliate Blogging Section”</strong> as a free service to only our valued Vendors, Insiders

                                    are provided solely by the individual Vendor, Insider, Contributor and not by GetValue.co. Therefore the <strong>
                                        Affiliate Blogging Section</strong> is intended to help only Vendors, Insiders and Contributors provide their 
                                        helpful tips, product’s descriptions, Affiliates information and their promotions about their products to their

The Vendor, Insiders and Contributors <strong>Affiliate Blogging Section</strong> posting Guidelines are divided in four categories;</p>
                                <ol>
                                <li>Before you write: What we look for</li>

                                    Length: Pieces articles typically run about 600 to 800 words, though longer is OK. More than 1,000 words, however, usually is not ok.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Topics: Our content educates and motivates and finally markets. At GetValue.co users are looking for articles that inspire, give insight into current trends and offer actionable takeaway tips on the most impactful products and services available at our site store.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Clear and Focused message: We’re looking for new and fresh perspectives on topics our site users care about. To ensure you are offering an original idea:</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Search the site. You’ll discover what topics, products or services our site users enjoy and what and how we’ve already written on a topic. Make sure the article you pitch offers something our site users and Insiders haven’t seen before.</li>
                                <li>Consider your personal experience. What problems have you overcome? What unique perspectives can you bring? Telling that story is much more preferable than a personally inexperienced one while relating it to how the product you are promoting from our site store has helped you solve all of your previous problems.</li>
                                <li>Look to the current events. News, events, life and industry changes might spark an article, a promotional material or a product or service review only you can write. Consider if you have insights into how a change might impact current life practices and how business owners and people in general can use a product or a service you are promoting to make them be prepared for such change.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Step-By-Step Actionable advice: Stories that don’t give our site users some of the actionable advice or takeaways tips from any product or service you are promoting won’t likely be selected for publication. To us, advice means usable, numbered tips our site can put to use right away. This is why tips in articles should be clear enough for our site user to put into action right away. The best tips are often ideas our site users haven’t seen before but offer them a new solution to a common problem.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Trustworthy sources: Be knowledgeable about the sources you cite. Rely on primary sources as much as possible. And remember that, most crowd sources of information from the public sites, doesn’t always offer the most accurate information. In general, we like to see Vendors, Insiders and Contributors to provide in at least a few links to the products they are interested to sell from only our site store. In this sense, while Insiders and Contributors may be allowed to proved links to outside websites (not GetValue.co or their own company) where our site users can find more information or additional resources on the topics discussed, GetValue.co Doesn’t allow Vendors, Insiders and Contributors to provide links linking our site users to products from other sites other than that of Get Value, Inc Companies’ sites.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Help snagging interviews: GetValue.co Insiders are happy to help approved Outsiders and contributors line up interviews with relevant sources. However, please run potential interviewees by your editor and get approval before scheduling an interview on your own, particularly if the person is well-known or notable. It’s possible a GetValue.co Insider may have already reached out to the person, and we want to avoid duplicate coverage.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Please note: While Outsiders and Contributors may say they are working on an article for GetValue.co when they approach public relations professionals or potential sources, other than Insiders, outsiders and contributors “ARE NOT” members of GetValue.co staff and that they should present themselves as independent parties working with GetValue.co and not represent themselves as staffs in such events or in communications with any sources.</p>

                                <li>No serial commas: apples, oranges and bananas — not apples, oranges, and bananas smileys instead.</li>
                                <li>The dashes we use have double hyphens and spaces: The CEO — whom the board tried to fire — addressed the scandal. We don’t use other kinds of dashes or, heaven forbid, hyphens for dashes.</li>
                                <li>Commas and periods go inside the end quote marks. This should be “ALWAYS”.</li>
                                <li>No double spaces after periods. To repeat again: “NO DOUBLE SPACES AFTER SENTENCES”.</li>
                                <li>Appropriate sourcing of quotes: This means that quotes should be attributed to a source, e.g.: statements like “‘Blah, blah, blah, Gaston Ngailo told me in an interview’ -OR- ‘Blah, blah, blah, Gaston Ngailo said in an interview with the On air With Millard Ayo or New York Times.?’” Are acceptable.</li>
                                <li>Single quotes belong only around quotes within quotes and in headlines and subheads. “NOWHERE ELSE”.</li>
                                <li>When putting affiliate links or any other links to other sites of your own interest, put in your own hyperlinks. Don’t put URLs in parentheses and expect Insiders to link them.</li>
                                <li>While writing articles, use one-sentence paragraphs sparingly. Too many makes your piece clunky. Three to four sentences is an ideal paragraph length.</li>
                                <li>Percent is used as a word. Never use %, except in charts.</li>
                                <li>While designing your head of your article, concentrate of a very short but complete and clear version of it relating to your main articles massage.</li>
                                <li>Subheads (copy that breaks up long chunks of text) should have the same, parallel format.</li>
                                <li>Don’t capitalize the words in subheads, after the first word.</li>
                                <li>If the first head is a full sentence, they all should be. If one has a verb, they all should have a verb.</li>
                                <li>Don’t use links in subheads. As described above, use them only in your text inside your article.</li>
                                <li>It is true that women hold up half the sky. Therefore; if you must use he, also use she don’t hesitate to use them. But always get around this awkward construction of at least sometimes, by pluralizing your pronouns. Instead of “An entrepreneur has his business to do”, make it “Entrepreneurs have their business to do” or instead of using He or she use they.</li>
                                <li>A company or organization or government agency is “an” or “it” and&nbsp; never “a” or “they”. Therefore; for the possessive pronoun, when you refer to possession by a single person or company, use “it’s” not “their”. Similarly, while remembering that, An audience is not “a” or “them”, when you write about a company’s web audience, mention the audience’s members before mentioning the same audience by using “them”.</li>
                                <li>Be consistent: If you start with the pronoun “you”, stick with it. Avoid mixing “we”, “I,” “he/she” and “you” all in the same context and content. Being consistence also mean sticking with the same verb tense throughout. While GetvalueCliks.com accepts other forms of tenses, remember that, the present perfect tense (That person has done the same thing for years) expresses ongoing, habitual action is much more acceptable.</li>
                                <li>Check for repetition of the same words, points and themes. That’s just to help you avoid poor writing.</li>
                                <li>Numbers under 10 are written out (unless appearing with the word percent.) Numbers 10 or higher are written as numerals (unless they start a sentence). Years are always expressed with numerals. Use “more than” rather than “over” with numbers.</li>
                                <li>Check quotes with reliable sources. Brainy quotes and unedited blogs are not reliable and therefore not acceptable.</li>
                                <li>Try to use simple language that everyone can understand and If in any case you must use jargons, particularly abbreviations and acronyms nobody else knows, spell these out on the first reference (followed by the abbreviation in parentheses). If possible avoid Abbreviations altogether. We don’t like that one. And In fact, we hate it.</li>
                                <li>Names: For the first reference, use the full name: Gaston Ngailo. For subsequent references, use the last name only. Even if Gaston Ngailo is your best friend, even if he was the best man at your wedding, don’t call him Gaston in your article.</li>
                                <li>Videos and Photos; If your article includes an embedded video from any video site or you include a photo both they should be from an original source or comes from a free or paid to use or else has no copy rights restrictions. Whenever necessary credits for any un original content from you as an Outsider or a Contributor personally.</li>

                                    <em>For your article:</em></p>
                                <p>
                                    Proof your article, a promotional massage or a review. Sloppy work won’t be accepted by GetValue.co insiders therefore; If your articles is filled with lots of typing and factual errors, it will not be accepted. Rely on our style guidelines. Again make sure your articles, a promotional massage or a review have as reasonable amount of&nbsp; strategically placed links linking to the products you are selling( if you are a vendor/seller) or promoting another person’s product or service . Though the main effect reasons out of your article, promotional massage or a review should serve to educate, not advertise (not having these links could also slow your earning ability this is why they should be strategically placed). If you quote someone or cite a statistic, don’t forget to link out to your source (Please link to the original source). This will help our site users to learn more about a topic and encourage your writing techniques and finally motivate you to write more articles, promotional massages or a reviews and submit on our site. Additionally, not having these links could slow the publication of your article, a promotional massage or a review. Don’t expect that our insiders will do your legwork for you. And if you interview someone, please say so in the piece. Your editor and the reader will want to know that you have conducted original reporting. Disclose any financial relationships. Please acknowledge financial relationships, if any exist, with the companies or individuals you write about or link to. This disclosure is very important to not only to GetValue.co but also to our other site users. Violating this rule could mean your article being removed from the site or the end of your ability to contribute to the site. If you have questions, please talk to our insider.</p>
                                <p>
                                    As described in detailed previously in this terms of service that, you cannot receive money from a business or person in exchange for writing about them or selling their products from their sites or any other than GetValue.co, It is also against our policy for Outsiders and contributors to sell links in their specific articles, promotional massages or reviews to people or companies outside GetValue.co. Outsiders and Contributors found to be violating these policies will be banned from publishing or selling anything in our site.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Support your argument with multiple examples: Prove your argument. Please use more than just one example (of a company, study, entrepreneur, etc.) to illustrate any point you make. We tend NOT to accept articles about a single person or company, unless that person or company is very well-known (e.g. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Zukerberg or Apple).</p>
                                <p>
                                    Tell us if it’s timely. Articles, promotional massages or reviews with a time peg can move through the queue more quickly. If there is a time peg (a Christmas articles, promotional massages or reviews, for example), put a note to that effect on the subject line so an insider can see that more easily.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Submit original work. Work you didn’t write is not acceptable. Warmed over posts (something you published previously with just a few new tweaks added) are also unacceptable. (Know that we usually spot these, and they make us very, very unhappy).</p>
                                <p>
                                    Since the primary purpose of our <strong>Affiliate Blogging Section</strong> is to Train, educate and Entertain, make sure your article, a promotional massage or a review isn’t overly self or product/service-promotional. If you are also a Vendor/seller at GetValue.co, mentions of your company, book, professionalism or a skillset should be used to demonstrate your expertise on a topic relating to the exactly product you are selling or promoting at GetValue.co. Again (the effect should serve to educate more than advertise). articles, promotional massages or reviews that excessively promote your brand, company or product likely won’t be distributed to our social network profiles and therefore removed. Excessive links to the products you are selling or initiatives will likely be deleted. (One, two or 3 to 6 maximum links are fine. More than that, are not accepted.)</p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>For your GetValue.co account profile:</em></p>

You are also required to submit a unique email address that will be used as a means of payment by our site content-management-system to send you a check and also help GetValue.co to find you (or publicist) to log into our site content-management-system account.

                                <p>
                                    III. After you submit: What to expect</p>
                                <ol>
                                <li>Due to the large volume of submissions we receive, contributors should expect to receive a response within 3-7 days. If you have not heard from us after 10 days, your article, a promotional massage or a review was likely rejected.</li>
                                <li>If your article, a promotional massage or a review is accepted, GetValue.co will create a profile for the Outsider or a Contributor in the Content Management System (CMS). Once you receive an on-boarding email from our CMS, you will be asked to upload a two- to three-sentence bio and your headshot (high quality only, please) in our system, along with the social media handles you would like to include. For your professional bio, don’t use superlatives or overly promotional or personal language. Provide the city of the company’s headquarters and where you are located, if different. Hyperlink your company name and any published book, if you would like to.</li>
                                <li>Submitted posts are colour coded in our CMS.</li>
                                <li>Yellow: The piece is under review and you can edit it.</li>

                                <p>Customers requesting a return after expiration of the return period set forth in the applicable Vendor Return Policy will be required to work directly with the vendor for technical support or customer service. Vendors may request a return, on behalf of a customer, of any purchase up to 90 days after the date of the GetValue.co customer’s purchase.</p>
                                <p>If a customer requests a return and the return is approved by us, the money for the requested transaction is refunded back to the customer, in part or whole. If the return is for a recurring billing product, then the return policy allows for the most recent payment to be refunded. Multiple payment returns can be provided as long as they are within the applicable Vendor Return Policy. A return on a recurring billing product will also result in cancellation. Returns will only be credited back to the account used to make the original purchase. If the original account has been closed, the purchase is not eligible for return.</p>
                                <p>When a product is returned, the customer generally receives a full refund. Payouts from that sale are debited back out of the corresponding vendor and affiliate accounts. Due to the digital formats (Downloadable products) of GetValue.co products, when a product is returned the customer retains the product and, in many cases, the customer has received a benefit from the product prior to the return. In such cases, GetValue.co reserves the right to issue a refund for less than the full purchase price.</p>
                                <p>Reasons Why a Purchase May Be Refunded</p>
                                <p>As our Motto GetValue.co has every reason to keep customers happy by providing quality digital products and services. Therefore, to promote customer satisfaction, GetValue.co reserves the right to reverse a sale, including but not limited to the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>If the customer provides a valid reason for requesting a return within the time frame permitted in the applicable Vendor Return Policy;</li>
                                <li>If the vendor of the product requests a return on the customer’s behalf within 90 days of purchase if our customer service team confirms there is a valid reason for the return;</li>
                                <li>If the customer provides a valid report that the charge was fraudulent or unauthorized;</li>
                                <li>For any other reason GetValue.co deems appropriate.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Our Product or service Cancellation Policy</p>
                                <p>For the case of products that are accessed directly from our site web-pages, immediately after a refund request your GetValue.co access account will automatically be cancelled to limit your access of the respective products or services. A customer may cancel a product with a recurring billing subscription at any time. A cancellation means that no future payments are charged to the customer’s account. The cancellation of a recurring billing product does not generate a refund – it will only stop any future payments.</p>
                                <p>Abuse of the Return Policy</p>
                                <p>Customers requesting serial or repeated returns may be blocked from making further purchases using the GetValue.co services. Customers that violate the terms of use of a product may have their right of return revoked for such product.</p>
                                <p>Note to our Clients</p>
                                <p>This Return, Refund and Cancellation Policy is part of, these Terms of Services.
