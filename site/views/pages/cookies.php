                                    Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when 
                                    you visit a certain webpage. Cookies are then sent back to the originating webpage on each subsequent visit, or to another 
                                    webpage that recognises that cookie. Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. 
                                    Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically 
                                    once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. 
                                    They can be used by the Website to recognise your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again. Cookies

                                    you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience, as well as 
                                    to provide information to the owners of the Website. Therefore Cookies enables us to gather keywords from URLs of web-pages 
                                    from which you accessed our site and operate our site more effectively in such a way it reflects your personal preferences, 
                                    based on your previous browsing on GetValue.co. For example: Cookies may tell us whether you have visited the Website 
                                    before or whether you are a new visitor. They can also help us to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to 
                                    you and your interests. &nbsp;More importantly, cookies can also allow us to do various other things, as explained below

                                                    As you use our Website, you will notice that it features advertising. We allow third party companies, 
                                                    including advertising companies, to place cookies on our Website. These cookies enable such companies 
                                                    to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities so they 
                                                    can show ads that they consider relevant to you as you browse the Internet. These cookies are anonymous
                                                    — they store information about the content you are browsing, but not about who you are.

                                                    These cookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you’ve seen an ad or a type of ad, and how 
                                                    long it has been since you’ve last seen it. This information is used for frequency capping purposes, 
                                                    to help tailor the ads you see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads. Therefore; We may use these 
                                                    cookies on our site to help us to place relevant GetValue.co advertising on others’ sites when you 
                                                    visit such sites. We do this because we value your visit to our site and hope that you will be interested 
                                                    in other GetValue.co offerings when you visit other sites

                                                    followed to other sites. We will use this information to try and make our site and other sites that 
                                                    you visit more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with others, such as 
                                                    other Get Value, Inc companies and carefully selected third parties. For this purpose, We work with

                                                    On some pages of our Website, third parties that provide applications through our Website may set 
                                                    their own anonymous cookies in order to track the success of their applications or customize applications 
                                                    for you. For example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Website 
                                                    (e.g., Twitter or Facebook), the social network that has created the button will record that you have 
                                                    done this.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Because GetValue.co has its presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as 
                                                    possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks. We add buttons to 
                                                    allow people to easily share to those networks. We also use Facebook plugins to power the commenting 
                                                    functionality on our site. When we include these social ‘plugins’, it gives those sites the flexibility 
                                                    to use cookies. While they can’t read any cookies we set from GetValue.co, and we can’t read any 
                                                    cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of 
                                                    GetValue.co, and it also lets them know whether you’re logged in or not. For example, if you’re 
                                                    logged in to Facebook, read a post by Gaston Ngailo and want to make a comment, you can do that straight 
                                                    away without having to log in again – we never know whether you’re logged in or not, as you communicate 
                                                    directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site. Some pages of our Website may also contain 
                                                    embedded content, such as video content from YouTube or Vimeo, and these sites may set their own cookies.
                                                </p>

                                                    Finally you must understand that, because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor 
                                                    can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us.
